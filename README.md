# webhook-sink
webhook-sink is a lightweight service designed to receive, log, and inspect HTTP webhooks or callback requests during development and testing.  It exists as a self-hosted alternative to third-party webhook testing tools (such as RequestBin or similar services) that often impose request limits, retention limits, or paid plans.
